## Migration Strategy

### 1. Development Environment (Week 1)
- Set up feature branches for each fix
- Create shared types crate structure
- Update build pipelines

### 2. Testnet Deployment (Week 5-6)
- Deploy fixes incrementally to devnet
- Run parallel old/new versions
- Migrate test data

### 3. Audit Preparation (Week 6-7)
- Document all changes
- Prepare audit package
- Create fix verification tests

### 4. Mainnet Deployment (Week 8+)
- Gradual rollout with circuit breakers
- Monitor for issues
- Have rollback plan ready

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- Each fix requires comprehensive unit tests
- Minimum 90% code coverage
- Edge case coverage mandatory

### Integration Tests
- Full protocol flow with all fixes
- Cross-program interaction tests
- Performance benchmarks

### Security Tests
- Fuzzing for arithmetic operations
- Malicious input testing
- Economic attack simulations

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team
- 2 Senior Rust/Solana developers
- 1 Security specialist
- 1 QA engineer
- 1 DevOps engineer

### Infrastructure
- Devnet validators for testing
- Monitoring infrastructure
- CI/CD pipeline updates

### External Dependencies
- Switchboard VRF integration ($X/month)
- Pyth Network price feeds ($Y/month)
- Security audit firm ($50-100k)

## Risk Mitigation

### Breaking Changes
- All fixes except FIX_05 and FIX_08 involve breaking changes
- Plan coordinated upgrade with all stakeholders
- Provide migration tools and documentation

### Rollback Strategy
- Keep old program versions deployable
- Implement program upgrade keys properly
- Test rollback procedures

### Communication Plan
- Weekly updates to stakeholders
- Public disclosure timeline
- User migration guides

## Success Metrics

### Security Metrics
- Zero critical vulnerabilities in post-fix audit
- All high-priority issues resolved
- Comprehensive event coverage

### Performance Metrics
- Transaction success rate > 99.9%
- Average transaction time < 2 seconds
- Compute unit usage optimized

### User Impact Metrics
- Smooth migration for existing users
- No loss of funds during migration
- Clear documentation and support

## Timeline Summary

| Week | Phase | Fixes | Milestone |
|------|-------|-------|-----------|
| 1-2 | Foundation | FIX_01, FIX_02 | Type safety established |
| 2-3 | Core Security | FIX_03, FIX_04, FIX_05 | Fund safety secured |
| 3-4 | Protocol Safety | FIX_06, FIX_07 | DOS protection added |

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Create feature branch structure
   - Set up shared types crate
   - Begin FIX_01 implementation

2. **Team Preparation**
   - Assign fix owners
   - Schedule daily standups
   - Create fix tracking dashboard

3. **Stakeholder Communication**
   - Notify users of upcoming changes
   - Prepare migration documentation
   - Set up support channels

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a systematic approach to addressing all critical security issues. The logical ordering ensures each fix builds upon previous ones, minimizing rework and maximizing security improvements. Following this roadmap will transform the LocalMoney protocol from a high-risk system to a production-ready, secure P2P trading platform.

**Estimated Total Duration**: 8-10 weeks from start to mainnet deployment

**Critical Success Factor**: No shortcuts - each fix must be thoroughly implemented and tested before proceeding to the next phase.
