## FEATURE:

- Comprehensive pagination support for all query operations across programs
- Advanced filtering capabilities (by currency, trade type, trader role, status)
- Efficient indexing strategies for large-scale data retrieval
- Complex querying for offers with multiple filter combinations
- Trade history queries with date ranges and status filters
- Profile-based queries for user activity and statistics
- Optimized account scanning and data aggregation patterns

## EXAMPLES:

CosmWasm querying reference: `contracts/cosmwasm/contracts/offer/src/contract.rs` (query implementations)
- Complex pagination with cursor-based navigation
- Multi-parameter filtering with efficient data structures
- Type-safe query parameter validation
- Optimized data retrieval patterns

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient account scanning to minimize RPC load and response times
- **Data Structure Design**: Optimize account layouts for common query patterns and filtering needs
- **Pagination Strategy**: Implement cursor-based pagination to handle large datasets efficiently
- **Filter Validation**: Comprehensive validation of query parameters to prevent invalid or expensive queries
- **Caching Strategy**: Consider caching frequently accessed data to improve user experience
- **RPC Rate Limits**: Design queries to respect RPC rate limits and implement proper retry logic
- **Index Management**: Create efficient indexing strategies for common query patterns
- **Memory Efficiency**: Optimize deserialization to handle large result sets without excessive memory use
- **Query Complexity**: Balance query flexibility with performance to maintain responsive user experience
- **Future Scalability**: Design query system to scale with growing user base and data volume
