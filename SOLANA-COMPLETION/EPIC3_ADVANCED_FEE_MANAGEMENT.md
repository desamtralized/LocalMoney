## FEATURE:

- Complex multi-destination fee distribution system (burn, chain, warchest)
- LOCAL token burn mechanism integration with tokenomics
- Token conversion routes for non-LOCAL token trades
- Enhanced treasury management with proper fund allocation
- Dynamic fee calculation based on trade parameters and token types
- Integration with DEX protocols for token conversion capabilities
- Comprehensive fee validation and error handling

## EXAMPLES:

CosmWasm fee system reference: `contracts/cosmwasm/contracts/trade/src/contract.rs` (fee distribution logic)
- Multi-destination fee splits with percentage calculations
- LOCAL token burn implementation
- Token conversion route handling
- Complex treasury management patterns
