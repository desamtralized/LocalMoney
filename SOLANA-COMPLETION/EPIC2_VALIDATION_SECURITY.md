## FEATURE:

- Comprehensive validation logic for trade amount limits with USD conversion
- Advanced state transition validations for all trade lifecycle stages
- Ownership and authorization checks across all program interactions
- Automatic refund mechanism on trade expiration with timer-based state transitions
- Enhanced security measures for fund protection and access control
- Configurable trade timers (expiration and dispute windows)
- Robust error handling and validation for all edge cases

## EXAMPLES:

CosmWasm validation reference: `contracts/cosmwasm/contracts/trade/src/contract.rs` (validation functions)
- Complex amount validation with USD conversion logic
- State transition validation matrices
- Comprehensive ownership and authorization patterns
- Timer-based automatic state changes

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

- **Security First**: All validation must prevent unauthorized fund access and state manipulation
- **USD Conversion Logic**: Integration with price feeds for accurate trade limit enforcement
- **Timer Precision**: Unix timestamp-based timing with proper overflow handling
- **State Machine Integrity**: Ensure all state transitions follow valid paths and prevent invalid states
- **Gas Efficiency**: Optimize validation checks to minimize transaction costs
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Handle all possible edge cases including expired trades, invalid amounts, and unauthorized access
- **Cross-Program Security**: Validate all CPI calls and ensure proper authorization chains
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive input validation for all user-provided data
- **Economic Security**: Prevent economic attacks through amount manipulation or fee exploitation
- **Upgrade Safety**: Design validation logic to be upgrade-safe and backward compatible
