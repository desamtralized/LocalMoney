## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

- **Security Critical**: Arbitration system handles dispute resolution and fund distribution - security is paramount
- **Random Selection**: Implement cryptographically secure random arbitrator selection to prevent gaming
- **Fee Distribution**: Complex multi-destination fee splits require careful calculation and validation
- **State Management**: Dispute states must integrate seamlessly with existing trade state machine
- **Gas Optimization**: Minimize transaction costs for dispute resolution processes
- **Timing Windows**: Implement precise timing for dispute windows and arbitrator response periods
- **Cross-Program Integration**: Seamless integration with Hub, Trade, and Profile programs via CPI
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for all dispute scenarios and edge cases
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure arbitrator registration data cannot be manipulated or corrupted
- **Economic Incentives**: Proper arbitrator fee structure to incentivize fair dispute resolution
