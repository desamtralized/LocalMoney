## FEATURE:

- Complete TypeScript SDK implementation with all placeholder methods functional
- Proper IDL integration with automatic type generation and validation
- Transaction building utilities with batch transaction support
- Comprehensive error handling with custom error types and user-friendly messages
- Account fetching logic with efficient caching and data management
- Helper methods for common operations and complex workflows
- Gas optimization utilities and transaction cost estimation
- Testing framework with unit tests, integration tests, and mock providers

## EXAMPLES:

Current SDK structure: `contracts/solana/sdk/src/index.ts` (architecture reference)
- Well-designed TypeScript interfaces and type definitions
- Proper Anchor integration patterns with PDA derivation
- Comprehensive IDL-generated types and enums
- Placeholder methods requiring full implementation

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

- **Type Safety**: Maintain strong TypeScript typing throughout SDK with proper IDL integration
- **Developer Experience**: Create intuitive APIs that abstract complex Solana concepts for ease of use
- **Error Handling**: Provide clear, actionable error messages that help developers debug integration issues
- **Performance**: Implement efficient caching and batching strategies to minimize RPC calls
- **Testing Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite covering all SDK methods and edge cases
- **Documentation**: Inline documentation and examples for all public methods and interfaces
- **Versioning**: Proper semantic versioning with backward compatibility considerations
- **Bundle Size**: Optimize bundle size for web applications while maintaining full functionality
- **Mock Support**: Robust mocking capabilities for testing applications that use the SDK
- **Framework Agnostic**: Design SDK to work with React, Vue, Angular, and vanilla JavaScript applications
