### **Medium Risk**
- **Limited querying** impacts user experience
- **Simplified fee structure** reduces revenue flexibility
- **Missing LOCAL token integration** breaks tokenomics

### **Low Risk**
- **SDK placeholder methods** only affect developer experience
- **Missing documentation** impacts adoption but not functionality
- **Limited testing** increases maintenance burden

## Conclusion

The Solana implementation provides **~40% of CosmWasm functionality**, focusing primarily on basic P2P trading. The missing arbitration system and advanced fee management represent significant gaps that limit production readiness. The SDK framework is well-designed but completely unimplemented.

**Key Findings:**
- **Critical missing features** that prevent production deployment
- **Well-architected foundation** that supports rapid development
- **Significant development effort required** to reach feature parity
- **Good potential** for a robust Solana implementation

**Estimated development effort to reach feature parity: 4-6 weeks** for an experienced Solana developer working full-time.

**Recommendation:** Prioritize Phase 1 critical features before any production consideration, as the current implementation lacks essential security and dispute resolution capabilities.
