## FEATURE:

- Establish Solana program architecture and development infrastructure
- Set up Anchor framework workspace with program structure matching CosmWasm contracts
- Implement base account structures (PDA patterns for users, offers, trades)
- Create program error handling and logging framework
- Establish upgrade authority and program deployment patterns
- Set up local validator testing environment with Bankrun
- Define instruction discriminators and account validation macros
- Implement basic program initialization and configuration accounts

## EXAMPLES:

```rust
// Program account structure
#[account]
pub struct Config {
    pub authority: Pubkey,
    pub fee_collector: Pubkey,
    pub fee_rate: u16,
    pub min_trade_amount: u64,
    pub max_trade_amount: u64,
    pub paused: bool,
    pub bump: u8,
}

// PDA derivation patterns
seeds = [b"config", authority.key().as_ref()]
seeds = [b"user", user_pubkey.as_ref()]
seeds = [b"offer", user.key().as_ref(), offer_id.to_le_bytes().as_ref()]
```

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

- **Account Size Planning**: Pre-calculate all account sizes to avoid reallocation; use zero-copy for large data structures
- **Compute Unit Optimization**: Target <200k CU per instruction, implement compute budget management
- **PDA Seed Design**: Use consistent, collision-resistant seed patterns across all accounts
- **Rent Exemption**: All accounts must be rent-exempt; calculate minimum balances upfront
- **Program Size Limits**: Keep program under 1MB limit, consider multi-program architecture if needed
- **Cross-Program Invocation**: Design CPI interfaces early for token transfers and oracle calls
- **Idempotency**: Design instructions to be safely retryable without state corruption
- **Account Ownership**: Clearly define which program owns which accounts to prevent unauthorized access
- **Testing Strategy**: Use Bankrun for fast local testing, maintain >90% instruction coverage
