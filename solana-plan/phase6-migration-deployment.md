## FEATURE:

- Design data migration strategy from CosmWasm to Solana
- Implement snapshot mechanism for existing trade history
- Create hybrid bridge period supporting both chains simultaneously
- Build mainnet deployment pipeline with upgrade authority management
- Implement program upgrade patterns with state migration
- Create monitoring and alerting infrastructure
- Build admin CLI for program management and emergency actions
- Establish incident response and rollback procedures

## EXAMPLES:

```rust
// Program upgrade with state migration
pub fn migrate_v1_to_v2(
    ctx: Context<MigrateState>,
) -> Result<()> {
    let old_state = &ctx.accounts.old_state;
    
    // Migrate data to new format
    ctx.accounts.new_state.version = 2;
    ctx.accounts.new_state.data = transform_data(old_state.data);
    
    // Mark old state as migrated
    old_state.migrated = true;
    
    emit!(MigrationComplete {
        old_version: 1,
        new_version: 2,
        accounts_migrated: 1,
    });
    
    Ok(())
}

// Emergency pause
pub fn emergency_pause(
    ctx: Context<EmergencyPause>,
) -> Result<()> {
    require!(
        ctx.accounts.authority.key() == EMERGENCY_AUTHORITY,
        ErrorCode::Unauthorized
    );
    ctx.accounts.config.paused = true;
    Ok(())
}
```

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

- **Zero Downtime**: Design migration to avoid service interruption
- **Data Integrity**: Implement checksums and verification for migrated data
- **Rollback Plan**: Maintain ability to revert to previous version within 72 hours
- **Gradual Migration**: Support phased user migration over multiple epochs
- **Bridge Security**: Audit cross-chain message passing thoroughly
- **Key Management**: Use multisig for upgrade authority and treasury
- **Monitoring Setup**: Deploy Grafana dashboards before mainnet launch
- **Load Testing**: Simulate 10x expected load before deployment
- **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive migration guides for users
