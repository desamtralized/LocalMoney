## FEATURE:

- Translate core trading logic from CosmWasm to Solana programs
- Implement offer creation, update, and deletion instructions
- Build trade state machine (request, accept, release, cancel, dispute)
- Create escrow mechanism using SPL Token program CPIs
- Implement fiat payment method management and validation
- Build reputation and feedback system with on-chain attestations
- Create event emission using Anchor events and program logs
- Implement trade matching and filtering logic

## EXAMPLES:

```rust
// Trade state transitions
#[derive(AnchorSerialize, AnchorDeserialize, Clone, PartialEq)]
pub enum TradeState {
    Requested,
    Accepted,
    FiatDeposited,
    Released,
    Cancelled,
    Disputed,
    Resolved,
}

// Offer instruction
pub fn create_offer(
    ctx: Context<CreateOffer>,
    offer_type: OfferType,
    token_mint: Pubkey,
    fiat_currency: String,
    rate: u64,
    min_amount: u64,
    max_amount: u64,
) -> Result<()> {
    // Validation and offer creation logic
}
```

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

- **Atomic State Transitions**: Ensure all trade state changes are atomic and reversible
- **Escrow Safety**: Implement time-locks and multi-signature requirements for fund releases
- **Rate Limiting**: Add per-user limits to prevent spam and DOS attacks
- **Decimal Precision**: Use fixed-point arithmetic for exchange rates (8 decimals standard)
- **Trade Expiry**: Implement automatic trade cancellation after timeout periods
- **Dispute Resolution**: Design arbitrator selection and voting mechanisms
- **Gas Optimization**: Batch similar operations to reduce transaction costs
- **Data Indexing**: Structure accounts for efficient querying via getProgramAccounts
- **Partial Fills**: Support partial trade amounts within min/max boundaries
